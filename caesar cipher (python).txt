What caesar have to do with it? idfk.

[process is pretty easy to crack 25 encryption key]

Normal alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
                ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
Shift by 3:     D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C

[shift by 3]

"HELLO" becomes "KHOOR"
Why?
H → K (H+I+J+K = 3 steps forward)
E → H (E+F+G+H = 3 steps forward)
L → O (L+M+N+O = 3 steps forward)
L → O
O → R

To decode:

"KHOOR" becomes "HELLO"
K → H (K-J-I-H = 3 steps backward)
H → E (H-G-F-E = 3 steps backward)
O → L
O → L
R → O

if i got thousand letter that gonna take few day to decode
